<h1>OxySlim Current</h1>
This is the current working version of OxySlim on the git and is considered 'bleeding-edge'.
Once a build is considered as tested it should be moved onto Testing to allow users to test the build,
if there are no volunteers/users who would be willing to test then it would need to be done oneself :/,
if it turns out fine after a day or two of usage feel free to request to move the build into stable.

Now hosting the files will be an issue that must be overcome, github has its size limits :/
