<h1>Fast image optimizer.</h1>
A batch image compressor for Windows from the devs of TruePNG.
Uses multiple software binaries (various tools) in order to slimsize the images present.
Either drag and drop the files or the folders with them into the commandline.

WHEN COMMITING CHANGES, PLEASE DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT COMPRESS LOSSY, unless you are editing
something like a bootanimation where it would be acceptable.

PNG24+A may be acceptable for some scenarios also.
