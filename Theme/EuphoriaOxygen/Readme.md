<h1>OxySlim Layers Themes Source Code</h1>
This part contains the individual layers themes per app used to theme the ROM.

Note: Most of these folders, due to originally speed up development are merely clone of the SystemUI layer without proper refactoring/renaming, 
the apps will compile with SystemUI's name so please rename them as necessary after compiling.
